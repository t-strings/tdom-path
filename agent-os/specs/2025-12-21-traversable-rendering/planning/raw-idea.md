# Raw Idea: PurePosixPath Rendering

## Feature Description

**PurePosixPath Rendering**

This feature involves writing a function that walks the tree looking for `PurePosixPathElement` and rewrites values into
`Element` with paths relative to the target. This is the next planned feature according to the project roadmap (item
#3).
