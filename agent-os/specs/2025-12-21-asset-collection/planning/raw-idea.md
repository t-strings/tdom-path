# Raw Idea: Asset Collection

## User's Request

"for `7. Asset Collection`"

## Context from Roadmap

- This is item #7 from the project roadmap
- It follows the completed features: Core Path API, Tree Rewriting, and Path Rendering
- The project provides component resource path utilities for web applications
- Current codebase: tree.py (691 lines), webpath.py (206 lines)
- Uses Python 3.14+, tdom for HTML tree structures
- Provides utilities for resolving component static assets (CSS, JS, images) as module-relative PurePosixPath objects

## Initial Observations

The Asset Collection feature appears to be the next major feature to implement after the path rendering capabilities.
